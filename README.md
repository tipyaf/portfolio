# 🌟 Portfolio v1 🚀

Welcome to **Portfolio v1**, a personal project built with [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) and [**Sanity**](https://www.sanity.io/)! This repository showcases my developer portfolio, highlighting projects, skills, and more. Dive in and explore!

## 🚀 Why Next.js? 🤔

I chose [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) for a couple of exciting reasons:

1. **SSR Power**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for fast and optimized performance. 🌍✨
2. **Learning & Fun**: I wanted to both **master** and **enjoy** working with this awesome tech stack! Next.js brings flexibility, speed, and joy to the development process. 🎉💻

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Here are the key technologies and tools I used to build this portfolio:

- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/): The React framework for production, with SSR, SSG, and great DX.
- [**Sanity.io**](https://www.sanity.io/): The structured content CMS powering the backend of this portfolio.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For a safer and more predictable codebase with static typing. 🛡️💻
- [**Framer Motion**](https://www.framer.com/motion/): To create smooth animations and interactions for an enhanced user experience. 🎥✨
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/): For code formatting, ensuring a consistent style throughout the codebase. ✨📝
- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/): For identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code. 🧹🛠️
